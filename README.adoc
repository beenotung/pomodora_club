== Background

Pomodoro is a technique for effective working.
It promotes focused working in task-based manner.

This time management method was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

== Pomodoro Principles
Below are the steps to apply the original technique:
1. Decide which task to work on
2. Set the pomodoro timer (for example 25 minutes)
3. Work on the task
4. When the timer rings, mark a checkmark.
   If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3-5 minutes);
   If you have four checkmarks, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), reset the checkmarks
5. Continue to work.
   If the task is finished, go to step 1;
   If the task is not finished, go to step 2.
